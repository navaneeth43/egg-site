### Project Description
"Is This an Egg?" is a lighthearted and interactive web project that mixes humor with surprise.
The page shows an image (often an egg) and asks "Is This an Egg?"

If you click "No" ‚Üí A new random image appears, along with a funny randomized response.

If you click "Yes" ‚Üí You‚Äôre instantly redirected to one of several random games!

This creates a playful, unpredictable experience for the user.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most games are predictable. This project adds humor and surprise by showing random images and launching a random game when the user clicks "Yes."

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
using html,css make a fun website note useless but they are good to use
