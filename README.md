### Project Description
"Is This an Egg?" is a lighthearted and interactive web project that mixes humor with surprise.
The page shows an image (often an egg) and asks "Is This an Egg?"

If you click "No" → A new random image appears, along with a funny randomized response.

If you click "Yes" → You’re instantly redirected to one of several random games!

This creates a playful, unpredictable experience for the user.
